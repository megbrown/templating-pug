# Templating With Pug

## Introduction

#### What is a templating engine?

A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At runtime, the template engine first parses the template. This allows embedded JavaScript expressions and variables to be evaluated and then transformed into an HTML file which is sent to the client. This approach creates the ability to pipe data from the server to the template, so it can then be parsed and sent to the client. If that sounds familiar, it should. You have worked with templates before with Handlebars, and in the Anugular templating system.

#### Pug

Pug is a clean, whitespace sensitive syntax for writing html. We will be using the Pug templating engine with our Express server. Check out the [PugJs docs](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) for more information.

BTW, Pug used to be called Jade. You will see references to Jade all over the place on the interwebs, since it was called that for a number of years.

Pug and Handlebars are very similar in their goals and end results. You're still going to bind javascript values to templates to create views to render in a broswer. But the implementation is slightly different. the first thing you'll notice is the syntax. Pug uses HTML tags, but in a whitespace-dependent syntax that does away with angle brackets (`< >`) and closing tags. Proper indentation is _required_. Without properly indented
code, Pug will refuse to cooperate.  (This is where your instructor tries not to say "I told you so")

What's that mean? Take a look. A rendered page of HTML that looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Pug</title>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      if (foo) bar(1 + 5)
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Pug - node template engine</h1>
    <div id="container" class="col">
      <p>You are amazing</p>
      <p>Pug is a terse and simple templating language with a strong focus on performance and powerful features.</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
Starts off looking like this in Pug:
```pug
doctype html
html(lang="en")
  head
    title= pageTitle
    script(type='text/javascript').
      if (foo) bar(1 + 5)
  body
    h1 Pug - node template engine
    #container.col
      if youAreUsingPug
        p You are amazing
      else
        p Get on it!
      p.
        Pug is a terse and simple templating language with a
        strong focus on performance and powerful features.
```

## Setup

```
cd ~/workspace/node/milestone-2/exercises
mkdir pug_practice
npm install express pug --save
touch server.js
mkdir views && touch views/index.pug views/about.pug views/inventory.pug views/nav.pug
```

Your file structure should look something like this:
```
pug_practice/
  views/
    index.pug
    about.pug
    inventory.pug
    nav.pug
  server.js
  README.md
  package.json
```

## Instructions

You have decided to finally pursue your life long dream of becoming a baker. After renting a space near the local town square, buying all necessary equipment, and hiring your younger sibling to work for you, the bakery is ready to open. Unfortunately, there isn't much money left, so you decide to build a simple website on your own. You have decided on the following, minimal features:


1. A home page that displays the bakery's name, a picture and a short bio.

1. An about page with a bio of yourself and the company's slogan.

1. An inventory page which would list the most popular pastries along with their prices.

1. A simple nav bar which does not display a link to the current page, but only the pages not being viewed.

  e.g: If the URL is currently `localhost:8080/about` only `Home` and `Inventory` links should be shown.


## Requirements

1. Set up a simple Express server with three routes; `/`, `/about` and `/inventory`. Each route should render the corresponding pug file.

1. Be sure to set Express' view engine to use Pug.

1. Using the `include` keyword, insert the nav.pug partial into each of the pug files.

1. In `about.pug`, create a variable to store the current date and time using the JavaScript `Date()` method. Using Pug's string interpolation, insert the date variable into a paragraph tag which should read: `Today's date is Sun Feb 19 2017 14:36:06 GMT-0600 (CST).`;

1. In `server.js`, create a variable that stores an array of at least 5 objects. Each object should contain a name and a price for a pastry. Using the `res.render()` method, send the array to the template. Using Pug's iteration methods, display each pastry as a single paragraph tag, e.g: `Blueberry Muffin: 1.59 each`

1. Using Pug's conditional syntax in `nav.pug`, write logic to determine which page is currently being displayed and only render the pages which are not being viewed.


## Bonus

1. Create a `layout.pug` in the `views` directory. By using the `extends` and `block` keywords, we can create a single pug file that will act as a parent template and can be inherited, or `extended` in a child template. The `layout.pug` should contain the `html`, `head`, and `body` tags. It can also `include` the `nav.pug` since `layout.pug` can be extended in each of our files.

1. Restructure `index.pug`, `about.pug` and `inventory.pug` to inherit `layout.pug`.

  HINT: Be sure to use the `block content` keywords in `layout.pug` where each child pug file will be shown.
